- | Operator | Name | Description |
  | & | AND | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 |
  | ⎮ | OR | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 |
  | ^ | XOR | Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 |
  | ~ | NOT | Inverts all the bits |
  | << | Zero fill left shift | Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off |
  | >> | Signed right shift | Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off |
  | >>> | Zero fill right shift | Shifts right by pushing zeros in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off |

  JavaScript stores numbers as 64 bits floating point numbers, but all bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits binary numbers.
  
  Before a bitwise operation is performed, JavaScript converts numbers to 32 bits signed integers.
  
  After the bitwise operation is performed, the result is converted back to 64 bits JavaScript numbers.
